Shiksha helps you create highly configurable, end-user experiences in education using NDEAR building blocks. Since Shiksha leverages NDEAR building blocks, this repository will contain the Shiksha API that the frontend uses, adapters to connect to different NDEAR building blocks e.g. registries, telemetry, etc.
